# percolation

## Summary
Estimates the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. Assignment from Algorithms, Part I Coursera course taught by Robert Sedwick.

## Problem
Given a composite system which consists of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials:
* What fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor?
* Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush throw the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as
percolation to model such situations.
